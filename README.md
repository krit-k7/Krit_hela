# 🪙 Simple Token Smart Contract

## 📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates how to **build and deploy your first ERC-20-like token** on a local blockchain environment. It was created during a hands-on blockchain development session to understand how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work at a basic level—but in a decentralized local setup using Solidity.

## 📜 Project Description
The smart contract implements a simple fungible token with a fixed supply. Once deployed, tokens are minted to the contract deployer's address. Users can transfer tokens to any other wallet on the same network.

This project helps beginners understand key blockchain concepts such as:
- Smart contracts
- State variables
- Token balance tracking
- Deployment workflow
- Local blockchain testing

## ✅ What It Does
- Creates a token with a fixed supply
- Allows wallet-to-wallet transfers
- Stores balances on-chain
- Shows real blockchain transaction behavior
- Teaches deployment steps and verification flow

## 🚀 Features
- 🔐 Decentralized – runs on blockchain, not a server
- 💸 Transferable tokens between accounts
- 📦 Fixed total supply
- 🧾 Transparent on-chain balances
- ⚙️ Easy to deploy locally (Ganache/Hardhat)
